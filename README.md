Below are just pieces of useless memories, better not to waste your time on it...
Below should be the second change, it's a statement of my experience 3 个月之内 uni:
Well, today, is 12/20/2025, there'll be about half 1 个月之前 away from my final exam of my first semester here at BUPT, and, i could say, i almost learnt nothing and not reviewing at all.
what a tragedy there
yet, i realise, the college education in China has been collapsed. but i'd rather not willing to have a further explanation here.
I tried to learn in computer science 3 个月之前 ago, but abondoned it later. I was trying to get into a kind of student tech team, a high-level one. Unfortunately but visionable, i was rejected since 
a lack of tech competence which i had already knew. I later had an option trying for a drone team, half way dropped it again. Seeing now, this time, i really shouldn't give up, at least i woulf have 
somethings to do. Also, learned algorithms, python, vibe coding....none of them i stick it through.  Anyways, im back in learning CS again. Its the needed way and a promising way to fulfill my personal value and dream,
thats why im editing this readme doc, as a jornal, maybe, also a personal memorial and sigh of emotion.
Well, feel bad for wasting time, but, let me be myself, let me discover, let me build, let me learn, let me zone in, less is more, simple is rich
